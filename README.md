==========

Originally a weekend project from AP Computer Science in 2010.

The `src` directory contains all the original source files from May-June 2010, 
although `index.html` was modified in March of 2011. The applet isn't properly embedded anyway.

In 2010 I was using Eclipse to handle building, so there is no build script yet.

The copyright notice in each file is what I used in 2010, when I knew nothing of licensing.
I will update this first.
